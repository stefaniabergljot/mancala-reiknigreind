""" Mancala

    The game board consists of two rows of six pits each, and two larger pits called Mancalas.
    Each player owns one of the rows and the Mancala to the right of that row.
    The game starts with 4 seeds in each of the 12 smaller pits.
    
    On a player's turn, they choose one of the pits on their side,
    pick up all the seeds from that pit,
    and distribute them one-by-one into the following pits in a counter-clockwise direction.
    If they reach their own Mancala, they drop a seed in, but they skip the opponent's Mancala.
    If the last seed lands in the player's own Mancala, they get another turn.
    If the last seed lands in an empty pit on their side,
    they capture that seed and any seeds in the opposite pit, placing all of them in their Mancala.
    
    The game ends when all pits on one side are empty. The player with the most seeds in their Mancala at the end wins.

The state of the game is represented in the following way:
    - One 1x14 array (board).
    - Indexes [0, 1, ...5]  represent the pits belonging to player 0 and index 6 their Mancala.
      Indexes [7, 8, ...12]  represent the pits belonging to player 1 and index 13 their Mancala.
    - board[i] represents the seeds in pit i.

    We can visualize the board in the following way

                     Player 1
                12 11 10  9  8  7
            -------------------------
           |     4  4  4  4  4  4    |
        13 |  0                    0 | 6
           |     4  4  4  4  4  4    |
            -------------------------
                 0  1  2  3  4  5
                     Player 0

    where the numbers inside the box indicate seeds
    and the numbers outside the box indicate the indexes
    of the array representing the state.
    The visualation above depicts the initial state (board).
